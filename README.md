1. Introduction 

The motivation behind this report is to detail the improvement of an Android application that looks at a client's age to renowned figures from history. The application plans to give a drawing in and instructive experience for clients by permitting them to enter their age and afterward matching it to the age at which different authentic figures died. The improvement cycle remembers carrying out the application for Kotlin, dealing with input mistakes successfully, restricting substantial ages, and setting up adaptation control with GitHub alongside executing GitHub Activities. 

2. Application Outline 

The Android application created is a basic yet intuitive device intended to furnish clients with experiences into verifiable figures' life expectancies comparative with their own age. Clients input their age into the application, and the application then, at that point, analyzes it to the periods of striking verifiable figures at the hour of their passing. 

3. Application Highlights Age Information: Clients can enter their age into the application. 
Age Correlation: The application looks at the client's age to the periods of well known authentic figures when they died. 
Mistake Taking care of: The application gives helpful criticism to clients assuming they enter invalid age data. 
Age Breaking point: Substantial ages are restricted between 20 years and 100 years of age. 
Inspirational Messages: Created messages propel understudies to address their feedback assuming it falls outside the legitimate age range. 

4. Improvement Interaction 

4.1. Programming Language and Devices The application is created utilizing Kotlin, a cutting edge programming language for Android improvement. Kotlin gives brief linguistic structure, interoperability with Java, and solid tooling support, settling on it an ideal decision for Android application advancement. 
4.2. UI Plan The UI (UI) of the application is intended to be natural and easy to understand. It incorporates a text input field where clients can enter their age and a button to start the age examination process. Also, mistake messages are shown if there should be an occurrence of invalid information.
 4.3. Blunder Taking care of and Criticism To improve client experience, the application incorporates vigorous mistake dealing with instruments. Assuming that clients enter invalid age data or ages outside the predefined range, they get valuable criticism empowering them to address their feedback. Inspirational messages are made to motivate clients to give exact data. 
4.4. Age Correlation Calculation The center usefulness of the application lies in contrasting the client's age with the periods of verifiable figures when they died. This is accomplished through a calculation that works out the age contrast between the client's age and the periods of authentic figures at the hour of their demise. 
4.5. GitHub Form Control and Activities Variant control is carried out utilizing GitHub, a generally involved stage for code joint effort and the executives. The application source code is facilitated on GitHub stores, considering consistent coordinated effort and rendition following. GitHub Activities are used to robotize undertakings like code quality checks, building, and testing. 

5. Execution Subtleties

 The execution of the application includes the accompanying advances: Setting up the Advancement Climate: Introduce Android Studio, Kotlin module, and design the improvement climate. 
Making the UI: Plan the UI design utilizing XML documents and incorporate it with Kotlin code. 
Executing Info Approval: Approve client contribution to guarantee it falls inside the predetermined age range. 
Coding the Age Correlation Rationale: Foster the calculation to contrast the client's age and verifiable figures' ages. 
Dealing with Blunder Messages: Execute mistake taking care of components to give criticism to invalid information. 
Drawing Age Line: Confine substantial ages between 20 years and 100 years of age. 
Adding Inspirational Messages: Specialty messages to spur clients to address their feedback if vital.
 Designing GitHub Vault: Make a GitHub storehouse for rendition control and coordinated effort.
 Carrying out GitHub Activities: Set up GitHub Activities to mechanize errands like code quality checks and building. 

6. Conclusion 

Taking everything into account, the advancement of the Age Examination Android application gives clients a drawing in and instructive device to investigate the life expectancies of well known verifiable figures comparative with their own age. By using Kotlin for improvement, carrying out hearty mistake dealing with systems, and setting up rendition control with GitHub and GitHub Activities, the application conveys a consistent and effective client experience. Pushing ahead, further improvements and highlights can be added to extend the application's usefulness and appeal to a more extensive crowd.
